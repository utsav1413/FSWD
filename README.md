# FSWD
# PROBLEM-1 TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

# Explanation:
1. Array of Task Objects:
   - Each task object contains `title`, `status`, and `priority`.

2. Add Task Function:
   - Uses an arrow function to push a new task object into the `tasks` array.

3. Filter by Status:
   - Filters the tasks based on their `status` using the `filter()` method.

4. Find High Priority Task:
   - Uses the `find()` method to get the first task with a `priority` of 5.

5. Map for Titles and Status:
   - Uses `map()` to create a formatted list of task titles with their statuses.

6. Log Task Details:
   - Iterates through all tasks with `forEach()` and logs each task's details using template literals for readability.

# PROBLEM-2 ONLINE SHOPPING CART:

# Explanation:
1. Array of Product Objects:
   - Each product object has `productName`, `price`, and `quantity`.

2. Add Product:
   - Adds a new product object to the `cart` array using an arrow function.

3. Calculate Total:
   - Uses `reduce()` to calculate the total cost by summing up `price * quantity` for all products.

4. Remove Product:
   - Uses an arrow function and `filter()` to remove a product by its `productName`.

5. Destructuring for Product Details:
   - Destructures `productName`, `price`, and `quantity` while iterating over the `cart`.

6. Cart Summary:
   - Logs each product in the cart using template literals for a readable format.

# PROBLEM-3 WEATHER FORECAST TRACKER:

# Explanation:
1. City Weather Objects:
   - Each object contains `cityName`, `temperature`, and `condition`.

2. Add City Weather:
   - Adds a new city weather object to the `weatherData` array.

3. Find Hottest City:
   - Uses `reduce()` to find the city with the highest temperature.

4. Filter by Condition:
   - Filters the `weatherData` array for cities matching the specified condition using `filter()`.

5. List City Temperatures:
   - Uses `map()` to format city names and temperatures as strings.

6. Log Weather Summary:
   - Logs all city weather details using destructuring and template literals for readability.
